title: Rendering LaTex formulas in GitHub Pages Using Mathjax

Dean Attali's [template](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) is an excellent tutorial for building GitHub pages. 
However, it did not provide solution to show LaTex symbols, which is crusial for math and statistics teachers or math-related users. 
Here's an easy way to solve this problem.

Basically, you only need add following script in your markdown file which contains LaTex inputs:

```
 Â <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Note that this script should appear before any LaTex inputs in your file.

It is tedious to add this script for every md file, so we can build a `_html` file in the `_includes` fold, named `mathjax.html`, 
which includes the very script mentioned above. Then we only need add one short sentence in the md file to get everything set: 

 > {\% include mathjax.html \%}

No configuration in `_config.yml` is needed! 

You can check my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/xkdog/xkdog.github.io) to see how this works.

See how beautiful these LaTex formulas are:

{% include mathjax.html %}

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$


$$ F(x) =\int _{-\infty} ^{x} \frac {1} {\sqrt {2 \pi} \sigma} \mathrm {e}^ \frac {-(t-\mu)^2} {2 \sigma ^2 } \mathrm {d} t $$



Try it out!
