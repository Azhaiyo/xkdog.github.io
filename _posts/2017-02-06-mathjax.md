title: Add LaTex feature beautiful-jekyll template Using Mathjax
published: true
---

Dean Attali's [template](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) is an excellent tutorial for building GitHub pages. 
However, it did not provide solution to show LaTex symbols, which is crusial for math and statistics teacher or relavent users. 
Here's an easy way to solve this problem.

Basically, you only need add following script in your markdown file which contains LaTex inputs:

```
 Â \\ <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Note that this script should appear before any LaTex inputs in your file.

It is tedious to add this script for every md file, so we can build a .html file in the "_includes" fold, named "mathjax.html", 
which includes the very script mentioned above. Then we only need add one short sentence in the md file to get everything set:

```
  \\ {% include mathjax.html %}
```  

Try it out!
